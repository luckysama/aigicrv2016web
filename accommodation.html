  <h1> Accommodation </h1> <br/>
  
  There are two places reserved for your stay for the 2016 AIGICRV Conferences. Either stay on the campus of University of Victoria with a walking distance to the conference venue, or book a room at the side of the beautiful inner harbour in down town. As a famous tourist destination, there are a lot of other hotels around Victoria down town. Since May is a busy tourist season, we recommend to book early to ensure room availability.
