  <h2 id="cfpAI"> <a href="documents\AI2016CFP.pdf" target="_blank"> Call for Papers for the 29th Canadian Conference on Artificial Intelligence (pdf) </a> </h2>

  This is a call for papers for the 29th Canadian Conference on Artificial Intelligence (<a href="https://conferences.lakeheadu.ca/ai2016">conferences.lakeheadu.ca/ai2016</a>), held from May 31st to June 3rd 2016 in Victoria, BC, on the west coast of Canada. The event is collocated with the Canadian Graphics Interface and the Computer and Robot Vision conferences. We welcome novel papers on all aspects of AI, either theoretical or applied. The proceedings will be published in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence series, and selected papers will be invited to a special issue of Computational Intelligence. All submissions will go through a double-blind review process. Submitted papers must be formatted using the Springer LNCS style and not exceed 12 pages for long papers or 6 pages for short papers. <b>The paper submission must go through our EasyChair site: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ai2016">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ai2016</a></b>.
  <p>
  Canada has a very active research community in many aspects of artificial intelligence, as well as a large number of companies where AI plays a central role. This conference is an opportunity for researchers from academia and industry, both from within Canada and from around the world, to come together to share ideas and foster relationships. The conference will be held in the historic and beautiful city of Victoria, also known as the Garden City. Come for the interesting papers and stimulating conversations set in some of Canada’s most beautiful gardens, parks, and historic buildings!

  <h2 id="cfpGI"> <a href="documents\GI2016CFP.pdf" target="_blank"> Call for Papers for the Graphics Interface (GI) 2016 (pdf) </a> </h2>

  <p>Graphics Interface (GI) 2016, the 42nd annual conference, will be held in Victoria, British Columbia from May 31st-June 3rd, 2016. GI is the longest running conference in the field, consistently attracting high-quality submissions on recent advances in computer graphics, human-computer interaction (HCI), and visualization. All accepted GI papers are archived in the ACM Digital Library. The Michael A. J. Sweeney Award will be awarded at the conference to the best student papers in graphics and HCI. Authors should consult the <a href="http://graphicsinterface.org/awards/michael-a-j-sweeney-award/#nominations" target="_blank">eligibility criteria</a> prior to submission. Authors of top papers will be invited to submit revised and extended versions to the journal Computers &#038; Graphics. </p>

  <p>GI 2016 will be held in conjunction with Computer and Robot Vision (CRV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). A single registration provides access to all keynotes, invited and paper talks, as well as a common poster and demo session of the three conferences.</p>

  <p>GI 2016 will have joint sessions for the graphics and HCI tracks. We seek submissions covering all aspects of graphics, HCI, as well as visualization. Authors must request that their submissions be handled by either the graphics or HCI sub-committee. In exceptional cases where significant overlap exists, a submission may be reviewed by members of both sub-committees. All paper submissions are fully peer reviewed by at least two members of the program committee and two external reviewers. Papers normally have a maximum length of eight pages.</p>
